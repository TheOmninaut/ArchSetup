An automated bash script to install packages and rice arch linux

Still incredibly early and only working on this in my free time so it only installs a few programs currently. soon i will add all of the planned features as well as details on the packages and reasons behind their addition.

NOTE: this is my just for my personal setup. its an ease of use for me so i can get my systems setup quickly for fresh installs and new PC's. Not intended for a general audience or a community appeal.
